You are going to fight with a dragon who wants to kill you. You will have a choice of easy and hardcore version. 
In easy version, you will have three options to use at each move:
1 - Sword. Sword does a big damage between 20 and 35, but hits only 70% of the time.
2 - Magic. Magic does lower damage between 10 and 15, but hits all the time.
3 - Heal. You heal yourself for 10 to 20 HP.
Dragon will hit you back each move between 5 and 15 damage, and he hits only 80% of the time.
You start with 100HP and Dragon starts with 200HP. 

In hardcore version, dragon is stronger and few new features added. You will figure it out. Choices and HP amounts stays the same.");
